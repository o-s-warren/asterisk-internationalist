On August 28, 2025, as the rainy season loomed, tens of thousands of Indonesians—workers, vocational students, and stay-at-home mothers—flooded the streets of Jakarta. They came in fury at the parliament’s decision to grant each member a housing allowance of fifty million rupiah—around ten times the city’s minimum wage—while ordinary people suffocated under a deepening cost of living crisis. Riot police responded with brutality: tear gas clouds filled the air, batons cracked down, and an armored tactical vehicle struck and killed a young online motorcycle taxi driver, Affan Kurniawan. His death ignited a wave of grief and rage that spread across the archipelago. And suddenly, the old chant for accountability swelled into a call for regime change.

By August 30, the uprising had reached Denpasar, Bali. The city where our film collective, QAMERAD, was born just a year earlier under the simple premise that cinema could be a tool for imagining queer liberation. That Saturday, students and online taxi drivers massed before the Bali police headquarters. Some of us joined the frontline, others tended wounds as part of the makeshift medical team. Coincidentally, our monthly screening was also scheduled on that same night, just a few blocks from the protest. As the day spiraled into violence, questions pierced our collective: 

When I wrote Queers Shoot Back!—my study of radical queer cinema—I leaned heavily on Latin America’s Third Cinema of the 1960s, especially Solanas and Getino’s militant manifesto that declared film a weapon against imperialism. Indonesia had never crossed my mind. The films I knew from that period—mostly Usmar Ismail’s—were psychological dramas of middle-class protagonists confined to bourgeois interiors. They were polite and even “apolitical.” Back then, my own country seemed absent from the militant map.
That illusion shattered in April this year, when I attended the Bali premiere of Turang (1957), a film once thought destroyed in the anti-communist purges of 1965, and recently rediscovered in a Russian archive by the filmmaker’s daughter, Bunga Siagian. Its director, Bachtiar Siagian, was a leftist voice erased from national memory. Watching Turang felt like encountering a ghost—not of an individual, but of a possible future violently amputated.
